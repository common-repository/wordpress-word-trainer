The WordPress plugin built for one thing only: teaching words

== Description ==

About a year ago a friend of mine asked if I could make him an application for his disabled grandson. He has trouble connecting an image, let it be a picture or something he sees with his eyes, to words. He told me he started using the computer and Word to learn him to type. We’re talking about baby steps here: a single picture connecting to a single word. He asked me to basically make a system which allowed him input words and pictures, and his grandson to playfully learn to connect them.

If you’re not looking for a word-teaching system, then this is not the plugin for you. Don’t despair however! I’ve got another great plugin ready and I’ll definitely be making more in the future.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the unzipped archive to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Download a WPWT-compatible theme in the `/wp-content/themes/` directory. See my website for the default theme.
4. Activate the theme through the 'Appearance' menu in WordPress
